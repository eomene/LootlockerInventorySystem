# LootlockerInventorySystem

An inventory system built with SOLID principles in mind. This connects to a backend structure called lootlocker available here https://www.lootlocker.io/ 
Code is sectioned into systems that can be reused in other projects.
Systems can be found in the scripts folder and they include :

## DraggableSystem 
asily drag and drop ui elements and also dr

## ListManagerSystem 
Easiy create lists of UI elements, instead of always instatiaing children when you intend to create a list. It supports a standard list with a parent and children as well as a list where the items also have child items. Good examples can be found with the inventory loadout and inventory list. Supports reusablity, used everywhere a list of ui elemtents needs to be generated. It also supports knowing everything about the list, when children are destroyed, count and much more. Can be easily extended based on requirements. 


## ServerRequestsPersistSystem
Work in progress - easily make server calls persitent. This means you can wrap your server calls so they must happen in the background. So you dont need to worry about your server calls failing. If they fail, the system will keep trying it in the background until it is sent. If the application is closed before it is successful. The system saves itself and reloads it so it can continue retrying in the background.


## TagNotificationSystem
Simple system to notify gameobjects when different activities occur. Similar to SendMessage in unity. But supports categories and tags.

## TextureDownloadingSystem
A hands off method of handling texture downloading from the server. Especially useful for projects that have images stored on the backend. Instead of always writing couroutines to download images when you need them. You can pass this to the system, and it downloads and makes images available to you when necessary. It also makes sure the same image is not downloaded twice by caching it locally. Also supports local images, so you dont need to have a different system for images in the project.
